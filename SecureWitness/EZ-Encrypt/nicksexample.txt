The AH-6i is one smart, nimble, observant, and heavily armed little battle chopper.
It takes the best parts of the AH-6M Little Bird operated by the 160th SOAR 'Nightstalkers' and infuses it with the latest technologies.
Many of these innovations are off-the-shelf components and developed from lessons learned over a decade and a half of warfare in Afghanistan and Iraq.
The whole idea of the AH-6i is that it can give AH-64E Apache-like capabilities in a package that costs a fraction of the price â€“ not just to purchase, but also to operate.
In fact, this advanced version of the Little Bird has the exact same mission computer and systems integration as the Apache, along with a similar glass and touchscreen cockpit.
This allows it to use the Apache's weapons, highly accurate navigational and battlefield management suite, and send video via its MX-15 electro-optical and targeting turret.
It can also receive video from unmanned aircraft, other helicopters (including the Apache), or from ground-based command stations.
Plus, missile launch detectors and countermeasure systems can be added and integrated into its mission computer in almost the same way as its bigger, badder brother.
